# Testing
- Debugging - cannot debug without first testing
- Cannot guarantee correctness, can only prove wrongness
- Ideally developer and tester should be different people
- Human testing:
    Humans look over code and find flaws
    code inspection and walkthrough:
- Machine Testing run program on selected input
- We can't check everything. Must choose test cases carefully
- Black Box Testing
    Various Classes of input
    Boundaries of valid data ranges (edge cases)
    Multiple simultaneous boundaries (corner cases)
    Intuition and experience - guess at likely errors
    Extreme cases
- White box Testing
    Execute all logical paths through the program
    Make sure every fâ€™n runs.
- Performance Testing - is the program fast enough
- Regression Testing
    Make sure new changes don't break old test cases
- Test suits and testing scripts
